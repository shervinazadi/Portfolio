# Generating DOI

---
There are only eight agencies who issue DOI’s and any other agency has an agreement in place with one of these eight. Therefore, the DOI system is very much centralized.
[DOI Registration Agencies](https://www.doi.org/registration_agencies.html)

>>> DOIs for most scholarly publications are issued through CrossRef. CrossRef do not assign DOIs directly, but delegate this to members or their agents. Members, who are usually publishers, pay a fee to the central consortium, and agree to issue DOIs based on a [fixed set of rules](http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/59pub_rules.html) .
> As you can see from these rules, the general sense of membership is “organisations issuing DOIs for stuff they control”. While there isn’t an explicit prohibition against assigning DOIs to third-party material (which surprised me!), point 4 comes pretty close:
> _Members have an obligation to maintain the metadata and URLs associated with all registered DOIs._

However there are some websites that they generate DOIs for the materials that we upload *only on their website*:
* [Zenodo - Research. Shared.](https://zenodo.org/) : **This one will accept a github page as well**
* [figshare - credit for all your research](https://figshare.com/)
* [The Dataverse Project - Dataverse.org](https://dataverse.org/)
